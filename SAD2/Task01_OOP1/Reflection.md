# Reflection

## What I learned
I learned how to identify system classes and represent them using a UML class diagram. I also understood inheritance, aggregation, and composition relationships.

## What was challenging
The most challenging part was deciding the correct relationships between classes, especially composition and aggregation.

## What I improved from previous tasks
I improved my ability to organize classes clearly and represent system structure in a more accurate and readable way.
