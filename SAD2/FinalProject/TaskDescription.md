# Task – Software Project with Design Principles and Testing

The objective of this task is to select a runnable software project and analyze it
from a software engineering perspective.

In this task, a calculator application was used as the selected software project.
The project demonstrates the application of software engineering principles and
design patterns, in addition to applying both manual and automated testing.

The task includes:
- Identifying software engineering principles already applied in the project
- Identifying design patterns used in the system
- Applying testing using both manual test cases and automated test scripts

This task helps in understanding how theoretical concepts are applied in a real
working software project.
