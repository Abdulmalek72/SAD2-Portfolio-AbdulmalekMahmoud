# Reflection

## What I learned
I learned how to analyze an existing runnable software project and identify
software engineering principles and design patterns applied in real code.
I also gained practical experience in combining manual and automated testing.

## What was challenging
The most challenging part was identifying design principles and patterns from
existing code instead of designing them from scratch.

## What I improved from previous tasks
Compared to previous tasks, I improved my ability to evaluate real software,
apply structured testing, and connect theoretical concepts with practical
implementation.
