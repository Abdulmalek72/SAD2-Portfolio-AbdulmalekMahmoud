# Task – Improved Class Diagram (Hospital Management System)

The objective of this task is to refine the hospital management system class diagram
by applying SOLID principles, mainly Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and
Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

The design separates responsibilities into dedicated classes such as Schedule and
IdValidator to avoid overloading main entities with multiple responsibilities.
ID validation is handled independently to ensure clean input validation and better
system maintainability.

This task demonstrates improved system design, better responsibility distribution,
and extensibility without modifying existing classes.
