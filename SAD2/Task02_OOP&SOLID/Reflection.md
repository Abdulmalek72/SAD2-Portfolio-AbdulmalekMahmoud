# Reflection

## What I learned
I learned how to apply SRP by separating scheduling and validation logic into
independent classes. I also understood how OCP helps in extending system behavior
without changing existing code.

## What was challenging
The main challenge was deciding which responsibilities should be extracted into
separate classes while keeping the design simple and clear.

## What I improved from previous tasks
Compared to the previous diagram, I improved the structure by introducing ID
validation and dedicated scheduling classes, which made the system more modular
and easier to extend.
